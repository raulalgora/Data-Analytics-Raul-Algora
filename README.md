# Master in Big Data & Cloud - Raúl Algora López
Welcome to the repository of my **Master in Big Data & Cloud Technologies**! This repository contains all the code and projects I completed during the course, which include exercises, group data projects, and my final master's thesis (TFM). Below you will find a breakdown of the contents and their organization.

## 📂 Directory Structure
- **📚 Exercises**: This folder contains the individual exercises I completed during the master's program, categorized by the technology used. Each folder represents a different technology or method that was taught, with examples and implementations of the concepts learned.
- **👩‍💻 Data Projects**: This folder includes the three group projects where we were tasked with solving real-world problems. Each project represents an **end-to-end solution** using various data analytics and machine learning techniques. The challenges ranged from data wrangling and exploration to predictive modeling and visualization.
- **📑 TFM (Final Master Thesis)**:  **. 

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools Used
The projects involve a wide range of technologies, including:
- **Python** 
- **Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)** 
- **SQL & NoSQL Databases** 
- **Big Data Processing (Spark)** 
- **Data Visualization** 
- **Docker** 
- **ETL & Data Pipelines** 

## 🧑‍💻 Exercises
In this section, you'll find exercises grouped by technology. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific set of challenges and lessons that I completed, such as:
**Python**, **Cloud Services**, **Containerization**, **Big Data Processing**, **Machine Learning**, **Data Engineering**, **Streaming Analytics**, **SQL & NoSQL Databases**

## 🤝 Data Projects
In this folder, you'll find the group projects that were focused on solving real-world problems with end-to-end solutions. Each project follows the typical **Data Science pipeline**:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing data.
2. **Data Analysis & Exploration**: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models for prediction or classification.
4. **Deployment**: Building an interactive dashboard or deploying models to production.

The three projects are:
1. **Plataforma interactiva de análisis inmobiliario.** 
2. **Sistema de conexión en tiempo real entre necesidad y ayuda.**
